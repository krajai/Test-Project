#this task was really interesting, this is the question originally asked by google, and they official answer for this question is 50:50
#but im not satisfy with that answer, as there are no ground truth about the question,
#for example there is no truth about what is the probabily of child being girl or boy base on the family tree
#they might me possible in 1000000 couple, they are few women who cant get pregent, they are few men who cant make reproduction
#some might die 
#some people are physically or mentally ill
#some kids may die before born
#they are many possibilties for different kind of situation here in this question.
#but for my task i just try to do simulation for 1000000 families, till all this family get a boy child born(2nd generation of family)
